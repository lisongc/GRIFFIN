# GRIFFIN (Gauge-invariant Resonance In Four-Fermion INteractions) 
project with ayres freitas
This is a project for computing precision observables at Z/W-boson resonance at the hadron(lepton) colliders.
gauge-invariant calculation under pole scheme.
on shell renormalization scheme.
only NLO Standard model prediction of Z-pole at future e+e- colliders is implemented so far.
only effective weak-mixing angle and axial-vector form factor as EWPOs are implemented so far.
