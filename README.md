# GRIFFIN  
GRIFFIN (Gauge-invariant Resonance In Four-Fermion INteractions), as an object-oriented C++ library for electroweak radiative corrections, provides a modular framework of describing 2-to-2 fermion scattering processes with specific attention to a consistent gauge-invariant description of the gauge-boson resonance. Version 1.0 of this library provides Standard Model predictions for the 2-to-2 fermion processes with full NNLO and leading higher-order contributions on the Z-resonance.
