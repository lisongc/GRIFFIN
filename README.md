# GRIFFIN  
GRIFFIN (Gauge-invariant Resonance In Four-Fermion INteractions), as an object-oriented C++ library for electroweak radiative corrections, provides a modular framework of describing 2-to-2 fermion scattering processes with specific attention to a consistent gauge-invariant description of the gauge-boson resonance. Version 1.0 of this library provides Standard Model predictions for the 2-to-2 fermion processes with full NNLO and leading higher-order contributions on the Z-resonance.

# Download and Installation
One can download the released version-1.0 from [here](https://github.com/lisongc/GRIFFIN/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

To run and test the program, please run

```bash
make testmatel
``` 

to compile the testprogram.
There are three test programs: `testmatel`, `testdeltar`, and `testtools`. One can switch the option by 
changing the `MAIN` in the `makefile`.

# Manual
